    The style embedding should provide information of the speaker and their speaking style

    The feedback signal for the module will come from the TTS objective, so it doesn't have a dedicated train loop.
    The train loop does however supply supervision in the form of a barlow twins objective.

    See the git history for some other approaches for style embedding, like the SWIN transformer
